### What is crontab?
The `crontab` (cron table) is a configuration file containing scheduled jobs. Each user has their own crontab.

```bash
# Edit your personal cron jobs (uses default editor, usually vim/nano)
crontab -e

# View your scheduled jobs
crontab -l

# Danger! Delete all your cron jobs
crontab -r
